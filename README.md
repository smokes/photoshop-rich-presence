## What you need to setup the RPC
- Any Version of ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/))
- Git (maybe not)
- Photoshop and Discord (obivously)
- Windows Only (atm)

## How to use
`$ git clone git@github.com:imsmokie/photoshop-rich-presence.git
$ cd photoshop-rich-presence
$ node index.js`
And then execute Photoshop
> Note that there is no need to install dependencides because i decided to include them in the repo due to node-gyp erroring out 
> If any errors occur when trying to run index.js please run npm install -g windows-build-tools

## To do
- Figure out a way to automatically execute whenever Photoshop is opened 
- Add Support for Macos
